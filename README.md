# University Management System – Python Simulation (Google Colab)

This project is a small Python-based simulation of a university management system.  
It was developed in a Google Colab notebook and demonstrates object-oriented design, class interactions, and a simple simulation flow that shows how the system operates.

## Project Overview
The system models the basic structure of a university environment using multiple classes, including:
- Student
- Course
- Lecturer
- Department

Each class contains attributes and methods that represent real-world behaviors, such as course enrollment, department management, lecturer assignment, and more.

A short simulation at the end of the notebook demonstrates how the objects interact and how the system behaves in practice.

## Features
- Object-oriented design implemented in pure Python  
- Classes representing students, courses, lecturers, and departments  
- Methods that simulate realistic operations (e.g., registering a student to a course, assigning lecturers, creating schedules, etc.)  
- A final simulation block that ties everything together and prints the system’s behavior

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Run the cells in order  
3. View the printed simulation results at the end  

## Purpose of the Project
This project was created to practice:
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python  
- Building class structures and relationships  
- Simulating a small real-world system  
- Organizing code clearly within a Colab notebook

## Files
- `pyhton1.ipynb` – main notebook containing all classes and the simulation  
- `README.md` – documentation for the project
